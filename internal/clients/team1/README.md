# Strategy

* Foraging: 
  - forage deer with an amount inversely proportional to the sum of last turn's foraging
  - always share forage information
* Tax: always paid
* Request allocation when close to critical
* Steal from common pool when critical
* Gifts:
  - Request when critical
  - Opinion on other teams depends on how many gifts they gave us.
  - Give requested gifts if opinion of requester is positive, or if they are critical and opinion is neutral.
  
## Policy

### President
* Tiered tax system, flat tax rate for those not reporting their 


## Foraging assumptions

* Total resources out are proportional to total contributions
* There is an upper limit to a hunt's rewards
* Number of participants does not matter for total utility, only total
  contribution matters
* We don't know the split of resources to contributors
* There is a population of deer that changes depending on hunting intensity
